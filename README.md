# SDA_web description
Webpage for the final project of Social Data Analysis course at DTU

The link for the public webpage: https://noramurakozy.github.io/SDA_web/

The page gives an overview of the analysis and connection between the tree density/green areas and number of crimes in San Francisco

### Guidelines to edit the content of the website

Guide to edit the content in index.md (this file gives the main content of the page): https://www.markdownguide.org/tools/github-pages/

If you want to create a new page, create a new file with the name page_name.md and add the content. The page will be accessible on the url https://noramurakozy.github.io/SDA_web/page_name (Source: https://jekyllrb.com/docs/pages/) - but a one-pager site works in our case as well, not necessary to create a new page.

Guide to edit the layout or CSS (in rare cases only): https://github.com/pages-themes/cayman

### Guide to commit the changes

Important: **Only the changes on the *gh-pages* branch will have effect on the website**

It's possible to edit the files here in GitHub (open a file under the Code tab and click the pencil icon in the upper right corner), you can commit the changes by defining the title and description of the commit in the bottom of the page.

It's also possible to clone the whole repository locally, and work there, but don't forget to switch to the *gh-pages* branch before doing the changes.
Note: you might need a personal access token to push the changes, which can be generated under Profile/Settings/Developer settings/Personal access token. GitHub does not accept passwords for authentication since 2021 August.

Note2: It takes some time for the changes to take effect, because of the deployment check in the background which can even take 20 minutes in the worst case. (It's like that by default, not controlled by me.)
